# Unit V: Basics of Angular

1. **Question:** What is Angular, and what are its main features?
   **Answer:** Angular is a TypeScript-based open-source web application framework maintained by Google. Its main features include two-way data binding, modular architecture, dependency injection, and a comprehensive set of tools for building single-page applications.

2. **Question:** How do you install Angular in a project?
   **Answer:** Angular can be installed in a project using the Angular CLI (Command Line Interface) by running the command `npm install -g @angular/cli` to install the Angular CLI globally, followed by `ng new project-name` to create a new Angular project.

3. **Question:** What is TypeScript, and why is it used in Angular?
   **Answer:** TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and other features to the language. It is used in Angular for enhanced tooling, better error detection, and improved maintainability of large-scale applications.

4. **Question:** What are Angular modules, and why are they important?
   **Answer:** Angular modules (NgModule) are containers for a cohesive block of code dedicated to an application domain, workflow, or closely related set of capabilities. They help organize the application into manageable units and enable lazy loading for better performance.

5. **Question:** What are Angular components, and how do you create them?
   **Answer:** Angular components are the building blocks of Angular applications, representing different parts of the user interface. They can be created using the Angular CLI command `ng generate component component-name`.

6. **Question:** What are directives in Angular, and what is the difference between structural and attribute directives?
   **Answer:** Directives are markers on DOM elements that tell Angular to attach specific behavior to them. Structural directives like *ngIf and *ngFor change the structure of the DOM, while attribute directives like ngStyle and ngClass change the appearance or behavior of an element.

7. **Question:** Explain string interpolation and event binding in Angular.
   **Answer:** String interpolation allows you to display component data in the HTML template using double curly braces {{ }}. Event binding allows you to respond to user actions like clicks or keypresses by binding methods from the component class to events in the template.

8. **Question:** What is property binding in Angular?
   **Answer:** Property binding allows you to set the value of an HTML element property (such as src, href, or value) based on a component property, enabling data flow from the component class to the template.

9. **Question:** What is dependency injection (DI) in Angular?
   **Answer:** Dependency injection is a design pattern used in Angular to provide objects (services, components, etc.) with the dependencies they need. Angular's DI framework manages the creation and injection of these dependencies, promoting modularity and testability.

10. **Question:** How do you create and handle forms in Angular?
    **Answer:** Forms can be created in Angular using template-driven forms or reactive forms. Template-driven forms rely on directives in the template, while reactive forms are built programmatically in the component class. Form input validation and submission handling are essential aspects of form handling in Angular.

# Unit VI: Handling forms and HTTP requests in Angular

1. **Question:** What are reactive forms in Angular?
   **Answer:** Reactive forms in Angular are model-driven forms that are built programmatically in the component class using form control objects. They offer more flexibility and control over form validation and submission compared to template-driven forms.

2. **Question:** How do you transform output using Angular pipes?
   **Answer:** Angular pipes are used to transform data in a template. They take input data and return transformed output, such as formatting dates, numbers, or text, or applying custom transformations.

3. **Question:** What are HTTP requests, and how do you make them in Angular?
   **Answer:** HTTP requests are used to communicate with a server to fetch or send data over the network. In Angular, you can make HTTP requests using Angular's HttpClient module, which provides methods like get(), post(), put(), and delete().

4. **Question:** What is a service in Angular, and why is it used?
   **Answer:** A service in Angular is a singleton object that provides functionality to different parts of the application. It is used to encapsulate reusable code, such as data fetching, authentication, or business logic, and promotes modularity and code reusability.

5. **Question:** How do you use services and dependency injection in Angular?
   **Answer:** Services are typically defined as TypeScript classes and injected into components or other services using Angular's dependency injection system. This allows components to access the functionality provided by services without creating new instances manually.

6. **Question:** What is the role of dependency injection in Angular services?
   **Answer:** Dependency injection in Angular services allows for loose coupling between components and services by providing dependencies when an instance of the service is created. This promotes code maintainability, testability, and scalability.

7. **Question:** How do you handle HTTP errors in Angular?
   **Answer:** HTTP errors in Angular can be handled using error handling mechanisms provided by the HttpClient module, such as catchError() operator in RxJS, to gracefully handle errors and provide appropriate feedback to users.

8. **Question:** Explain the concept of reactive programming in Angular.
   **Answer:** Reactive programming in Angular involves using observables and reactive forms to handle asynchronous data streams and user interactions in a reactive and declarative manner, leading to more responsive and maintainable applications.

9. **Question:** How do you perform form validation in Angular?
   **Answer:** Form validation in Angular can be done using built-in validators like required, minLength, maxLength, pattern, etc., and custom validators. Validation errors can be displayed in the template using Angular's form control properties and directives.

10. **Question:** What is the difference between template-driven forms and reactive forms in Angular?
    **Answer:** Template-driven forms are created and managed in the HTML template using directives, while reactive forms are built programmatically in the component class using FormBuilder and FormControl objects. Reactive forms offer more flexibility and control over form validation and submission compared to template-driven forms.
